In this project, I will perform some analysis on the dataset of Olist - An e-commerce platform in Brazil. The dataset is broken down into several tables, whose relationships to each other can be viewed here:

With this data at hand, this project will aim to answer the following questions using PostgreSQL: <br/>
1. What were the insights about the sellers in terms of the total number of orders, the total number of customers and the total revenue? From that, we can find out the information about the average value per order and the average customer value.
2. What were the market insights of different product categories on this platform?
3. How was the business performance of Olist? We will look at the total number of customers, the total revenue, the average value per customer, the average time it takes to ship to the customers, etc.
4. What was the running business performance of Olist?
5. Other information such as the proportion of order status, the proportion of payment methods used by the customers.
